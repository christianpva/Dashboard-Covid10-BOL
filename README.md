# Dashboard-Covid10-BOL
Dashboard with Covid Data From Bolivia

You need to create an account in https://developer.smartable.ai/

Then you need to subscribe to the API of COVID-19

Update the Subscription-key in the Python Code, inside the source of the pbix file

Subscription-Key': 'XXXXXXX'

I used the following article to guide me how to make the connection: https://towardsdatascience.com/covid-19-data-tracking-with-python-and-smartable-ai-e06029207903

I am sharing the Python file and the Jupyter Notebook file too if you want to explore them
